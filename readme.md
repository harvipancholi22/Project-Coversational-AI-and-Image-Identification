ðŸ“œ Project Overview

The **Conversational AI and Image Identification System** is an innovative web application combining the capabilities of **Conversational AI** and **Image Identification** to deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience. Powered by **Google Gemini API** and a pre-trained **ResNet-50 model**, this system allows users to interact with both text-based and image-based inputs in real time.

Features

- **PDF Q&A System**:  
  Upload a PDF, extract its text, and ask questions related to its content. Responses are generated using the **Google Gemini API**.
  
- **Image Identification**:  
  Upload an image to identify objects or elements using a pre-trained **ResNet-50 deep learning model**.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  Designed with **Streamlit**, the application provides an intuitive layout and interactive features.


Technical Stack

- **Frontend & UI**: Streamlit
- **Backend Technologies**:
  - PyTorch and ResNet-50 for deep learning
  - Google Gemini API for Conversational AI
  - PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction
  - Pillow (PIL) for image processing
  - Requests for fetching ImageNet labels
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Refer to `requirements.txt`
